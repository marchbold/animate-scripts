## animate-add-multiple-ane-swc

This script allows you to add a collection of ane / swc to your project without having to go through the process of individually selecting each file.

When you run the command it will ask you if you wish to clear out existing libs. We suggest you do this the first time to remove any duplicates. Then select the folder with all your libraries in it. Eg the `ane` folder from `apm`. You can run it a second time to add a second folder (just select cancel so you don't clear out the list again).
